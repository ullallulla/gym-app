# Learning log

Last checkpoint: 2026-10-26.

## How we are working

- Learning through building is an explicit project goal. The user knows Python and TypeScript, wants to learn Go, and wants no Python in the application stack.
- Use small exercises with a concrete result. Explain the relevant concept, let the user attempt the code, review it, and verify the behavior together.
- Give hints and explanations, and provide complete examples when requested. Honor explicit requests to implement changes.
- `PLAN.md` contains the architecture and feature roadmap. This file records exercises, progress, and the next step.

## Completed so far

- Initialized a pnpm workspace with `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
- Added the Vite+ web starter, installed React and its TypeScript types, configured the React plugin, and enabled JSX.
- The user confirmed that the React frontend runs.
- Initialized the Go module `gym-app/api` under `services/api`.
- Implemented a Go HTTP server in `services/api/cmd/server/main.go`, listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Registered `GET /api/health`, returning HTTP 200 and JSON `{"status":"ok"}` with the JSON content type.
- The user confirmed that the backend runs.
- Configured the frontend development proxy to forward `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Separated `App` into `apps/web/src/App.tsx`; `main.tsx` mounts it into the HTML `#app` element.
- Removed unused starter assets from `src`. `public/favicon.svg` remains referenced by `index.html`.
- Connected React to Go through the development proxy. The user confirmed successful requests, visible errors when Go is stopped, and recovery after restarting Go. The production build passed during review.
- Added a PostgreSQL 18 Compose definition. The user installed Docker and Compose and reported that running `SELECT 1;` through the container's `psql` returned `1`.
- Connected Go to PostgreSQL with pgxpool and a five-second startup context. The user reported successful startup while PostgreSQL runs and an expected connection-refused error with exit status 1 while it is stopped.

Runtime success above was reported by the user. At the initial checkpoint, code was inspected without builds or automated tests. Checks from the resumed session are recorded below.

## Completed exercise: connect React to Go

Status: complete. The user confirmed successful requests, visible failures while Go is stopped, and recovery after restarting it. The production build passed during review, and the component now passes formatting and lint checks.

Current code state:

- `App.tsx` owns `apiStatus` state, initially `"Not checked"`, and renders the button and status paragraph. The unused import was removed from `main.tsx`.
- `checkApi` is inside `App`, fetches `/api/health`, checks `response.ok`, parses the JSON, and stores `result.status`.
- The relative URL uses the configured development proxy. The earlier absolute URL bypassed the proxy and triggered a browser CORS error.
- The handler sets `"Checking..."` before fetching. Its catch block narrows `error` with `instanceof Error`, supplies an unknown-error fallback, and displays the error through state.

Initial review and verification (2026-10-26):

- Inspected the current component, entry point, proxy, API handler, scripts, and TypeScript configuration.
- User-reported runtime result: the request now works. Failure and recovery behavior have not been confirmed.
- Ran `pnpm --filter web exec vp run build`: failed with `TS18046` at `App.tsx:17` because `error` is `unknown`.
- Ran `pnpm --filter web exec vp check`: failed on formatting in `package.json`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`, and `vite.config.ts`. This did not establish a passing lint result.
- Ran `pnpm --filter web exec vp test`: exited with code 1 because no test files exist.
- Initially only the local Vite+ CLI was accessible through `pnpm --filter web exec vp`; its `vp env doctor` command required the global CLI.
- Tooling follow-up: the user installed global Vite+. Sourcing `~/.config/vite-plus/env` makes it available in the agent's existing Bash environment. Verified `vp v1.4.0` and ran global `vp env doctor`: all checks passed, using managed Node.js v24.22.1 and pnpm v12.3.4.
- The required Vite+ install hit restricted registry access and left the local executable unavailable. Restored dependencies successfully with approved `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; no manifest or lockfile changes were needed.
- Application code was reviewed without edits.

Follow-up review (2026-10-26):

- Inspected the user's updated `App.tsx`: loading state, error narrowing, and visible errors are now implemented correctly for this exercise. Explained ternary expressions, `instanceof Error`, and the `unknown` catch variable.
- Ran `vp run build` from `apps/web`: TypeScript and the production build both passed.
- Ran `vp check src/App.tsx`: formatting still needs correction.
- Ran `vp check --no-fmt src/App.tsx`: passed with no warnings or lint errors.
- Did not repeat the test runner: no test files were added since its previous no-tests result. Browser failure and recovery behavior remain unverified.
- Application code was reviewed without edits.

Completion confirmation (2026-10-26):

- User-reported runtime results: stopping Go produces a visible error; restarting Go and retrying returns the status to `ok`. These browser checks were performed by the user.
- Inspected the latest `App.tsx`: the user has formatted it, and the reviewed request/loading/error behavior remains present.
- Ran `vp check src/App.tsx`: formatting and lint both passed.
- Formatting findings in other web files from the initial review have not been rechecked. No new builds or tests were needed for this confirmation.

Completion checks:

- Clicking the button displays `ok` after the request completes (success reported by the user).
- Stopping the Go server and clicking again displays an error (reported by the user).
- Restarting Go and retrying recovers successfully (reported by the user).
- The web production build succeeds (verified in the follow-up review).

## Completed exercise: run PostgreSQL locally

Status: complete. The user confirmed installing Docker and Compose, creating `compose.yaml`, and successfully running `SELECT 1;`.

- Inspected the local environment: CachyOS (Arch-based). Neither Docker, Podman, nor PostgreSQL executables are currently on this terminal's PATH; no existing Compose or database setup files were found in the repository.
- Recommended Docker Compose and compared it with native installation. The user then requested Docker/PostgreSQL installation instructions for Arch Linux.
- Provided installation steps using the Arch `docker` and `docker-compose` packages, the Docker systemd service, and a `hello-world` check. Docker commands use `sudo`; no Docker group membership change is required for these steps.
- Proposed a root `compose.yaml` using `postgres:18`, a `db` service, database/user `gym_app`, local development password `gym_app_dev`, a port binding at `127.0.0.1:5432`, a named volume mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql`, and a `pg_isready` health check.
- The user should create the Compose file, run `sudo docker compose up --wait`, then verify `SELECT 1;` through `sudo docker compose exec db psql -U gym_app -d gym_app -c "SELECT 1;"`.
- At the instruction checkpoint, no database software had been installed, no Compose file had been created, and no container or database query had been run by the agent.

Completion review (2026-10-26):

- User-reported runtime result: Docker and Compose were installed, the Compose file was created, and the container `psql` command returned `1` for `SELECT 1;`.
- Inspected the actual root `compose.yaml`: PostgreSQL 18, the expected database/user, loopback port binding, a named volume at the correct mount location, and the readiness check are present.
- Ran `docker compose version`: v5.6.1. Ran `docker compose config --quiet`: passed.
- Did not run a container query or independently verify database connectivity. No application code or Compose configuration was edited during this review.
- Discussed `docker compose stop` versus `down` and how named volumes preserve database data by default.

## Completed exercise: connect Go to PostgreSQL

Status: complete. Startup connection checking was reviewed, Go compilation and formatting passed, and the user confirmed successful startup with PostgreSQL running and failure with PostgreSQL stopped.

Before the next exercise, restore PostgreSQL and restart Go. Recovery after this particular database-outage check has not been separately reported.

Initial configuration steps:

1. In the terminal used to run Go, export `DATABASE_URL='postgres://gym_app:gym_app_dev@127.0.0.1:5432/gym_app?sslmode=disable'`.
2. Add the standard-library `os` import in `services/api/cmd/server/main.go`.
3. At the start of `main`, read the connection string with `os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")`.
4. If it is empty, stop startup with `log.Fatal` and a clear message. If it is set, continue starting the existing API normally.
5. Review the user's attempt and verify startup with and without the environment variable.

Configuration review (2026-10-26):

- The user added `os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")` at the beginning of `main` and an empty-string check that calls `log.Fatal("DATABASE_URL must be set")` before starting the HTTP server. Inspected the code and found it correct for this step.
- Ran `gofmt -l services/api/cmd/server/main.go`: no formatting findings.
- Ran `env -u DATABASE_URL GOCACHE=/tmp/gym-app-go-build go -C services/api run ./cmd/server`: compilation succeeded; the program printed the expected missing-variable message and exited with status 1.
- Startup with a nonempty variable has not been independently checked. No database connection is attempted by the current implementation.
- Next, confirm the API still starts with `DATABASE_URL` exported, then install the driver with `go -C services/api get github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool`. This dependency command has been proposed, not run by the agent.
- No Go application code was edited during review.

The connection exercise introduces the pgxpool dependency, a context with a timeout, pool creation, and an explicit `Ping` to verify connectivity. Migrations and the first workout table follow successful Go-to-database connectivity.

Dependency inspection (2026-10-26):

- The user asked whether `go.sum` should be empty. Inspected `services/api/go.mod`: it now lists pgx v5.11.0 and its supporting modules, currently marked indirect. Inspected `services/api/go.sum`: it exists and is zero bytes.
- Verified that Go resolves the main module to `services/api/go.mod` and that no Go workspace is active.
- Explained that `go.mod` declares dependency versions and `go.sum` records dependency checksums. Proposed `go -C services/api mod download` to populate missing checksums without changing the selected versions. This command has not been run by the agent; await its result.

Dependency restoration confirmation (2026-10-26):

- The user clarified that they had run `go mod tidy` before importing pgx and then reran `go get` to restore the dependency.
- Inspected `go.mod`: pgx v5.11.0 and its supporting modules are present. Inspected `go.sum`: it now has 19 entries, including both pgx content and module-file checksums.
- Explained that `go mod tidy` follows source imports, so it removes a newly added dependency that is not yet used. Once the code imports pgxpool, tidy will retain its required modules.
- No dependency commands or builds were run during this confirmation, and no Go application code was edited. The next exercise is a startup connection check using a timeout context, pgxpool, and `Ping`.

Connection draft guidance (2026-10-26):

- Inspected the user's draft: `context` and `pgxpool` imports and a `pgxpool.New(context.Background(), databaseURL)` call were added. The call has an extra closing parenthesis; its `pool` and `err` results are not yet handled. No compilation or runtime checks were run on this incomplete draft.
- The user requested examples for the timeout and `Ping`. Provided a startup block using `context.WithTimeout` with five seconds, `pgxpool.New(ctx, databaseURL)`, explicit error handling, `pool.Ping(ctx)`, and cancellation once startup work finishes.
- Explained the two return values from `WithTimeout`, using the same context for the startup check, and `nil` meaning no ping error. Included pool cleanup on ping failure and when `ListenAndServe` returns, using explicit cleanup with the current `log.Fatal` structure.
- These are examples for the user to apply; no Go application code was edited by the agent.

Connection implementation review (2026-10-26):

- Inspected the updated `main.go`: it creates a five-second context, handles pool construction errors, pings PostgreSQL before starting HTTP, cancels the startup context after the ping, closes the pool on ping failure, and logs `Database connected` on success. The pool also closes if `ListenAndServe` returns, before logging its error. The implementation is correct for this exercise.
- Ran `gofmt -l services/api/cmd/server/main.go`: no formatting findings.
- Ran `GOCACHE=/tmp/gym-app-go-build go -C services/api test ./...`: passed compilation; the module currently has no test files, so no behavioral test cases ran.
- Ran the API with the deliberately malformed URL `postgres://%zz`: it printed the expected `create database pool` parsing error and exited with status 1 before starting HTTP.
- Did not connect to the live PostgreSQL instance or verify ping failure/recovery. Await those runtime results from the user. No Go application code was edited by the agent.

Runtime confirmation (2026-10-26):

- User-reported success: the expected startup messages appear when PostgreSQL is running.
- User-reported failure: with PostgreSQL stopped, startup prints a `connect to database` error ending in `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5432: connect: connection refused`, then exits with status 1.
- This is the expected startup error path. Connection refusal can be immediate; five seconds is the context's waiting limit, not a required delay before reporting an error.
- Reinspected `main.go`; no application changes or additional automated checks were needed for this confirmation. These live database results were reported by the user rather than run by the agent.

## Current exercise: introduce database migrations

Status: not started. Next, explain migrations as versioned database schema changes, select a migration runner, and create/apply the first small workout schema. Keep stable IDs and the ownership/change-tracking requirements in `PLAN.md` in mind when designing it.

No migration runner, migration files, or workout tables have been added or applied yet. Resume with PostgreSQL running and the Go startup connection check working.

## Commands for resuming

Run these from the project root in separate terminals.

Go API:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://gym_app:gym_app_dev@127.0.0.1:5432/gym_app?sslmode=disable'
go -C services/api run ./cmd/server
```

React website:

```bash
cd apps/web
vp run dev
```

Check the API directly:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

Check the web production build after finishing the exercise:

```bash
cd apps/web
vp run build
```

## Concepts discussed

- pnpm workspaces, root `node_modules/.pnpm`, dependency links, and keeping dependencies out of Git.
- Go module names and where `go mod init` creates `go.mod`.
- React components, JSX/TSX, and the roles of `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`.
- Go's `main` package, entry point, HTTP router, response writer, and response headers.
- `json.Encoder` writes JSON to a writer; `json.Marshal` returns JSON bytes. The health handler uses `Encoder` for convenience.
- Development proxying, React state, events, and `fetch` in the API button exercise.
- Ternary expressions, `instanceof Error`, and narrowing a caught value from `unknown` before reading `.message`.
- Go environment variables, empty-string checks, multiple return values, `context.WithTimeout`, its returned cancellation function, pool creation, `Ping`, and explicit resource cleanup.

## Later milestones

After completing the frontend-to-backend connection, introduce PostgreSQL and migrations, then build a small persistent workout flow. Clerk, TanStack Router/Query, dashboards, food logging, Expo/SQLite synchronization, and encrypted S3 backups are still future work described in `PLAN.md`.
